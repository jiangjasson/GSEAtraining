```{r}
mat = readRDS("golub_all_aml_gene_symbol_expr.rds")
dim(mat)
```

Perform consensus clustering/partitioning:

```{r}
library(cola)
res = consensus_partition(mat)
```

Select the best number of subgroups:

```{r}
collect_plots(res)
```

dimension reduction plot

```{r}
dimension_reduction(res, k = 3)
```

Get the signature genes:

```{r}
tb = get_signatures(res, k = 3)
```

Perform functional enrichment analysis on each row-group.

```{r}
lt = functional_enrichment(res)
```

Merge the four enrichment results:

```{r}
library(simplifyEnrichment)
simplifyGOFromMultipleLists(lt)
```

```{r}
simplifyGOFromMultipleLists(lt, control = list(cutoff = 0.8))
```
