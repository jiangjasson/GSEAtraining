To obtain GO gene sets, we need to use two packages: **GO.db** and **org.\*.db** packages.


## The GO.db package

We first load the package.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(GO.db)
```

### use GO.db as a database object

Before we introduce the **GO.db** package, we need to know that the **GO.db** package
is built on top of the low-level infrastructure package **AnnotationDbi**. Thus, almost all
Bioconductor "official data packages" inhert the same interface for querying data. Two important points:

1. There is a database object which has the same name as the package name.
2. They all implement the `select()` interface.

E.g. for **GO.db**, the object `GO.db` contains a connection to the internal SQLite database object.

```{r}
GO.db
```

`GO.db` can be thought as a huge table, where `select()` can be used to extract records from certain columns under certain constraits.

<img src="go_select.png" />


`GO.db` is a relatively simple database. The typical use is as:

```{r}
select(GO.db, keys = c("GO:0000001", "GO:0000002"), columns = c("ONTOLOGY", "TERM"))
```

It can be read as "select records in the ONTOLOGY and TERM columns of the GO.db table where GOID is GO:0000001 or GO:0000002".

The valid columns names can be obtained by `columns(GO.db)`.

```{r}
columns(GO.db)
```

But note for **GO.db**, there are already objects generated for retrieving GO data more easily.
It is unlikely in practice to directly use `select()`.

### The hierarchical relations of GO terms

**GO.db** provides variables that contain relations between GO terms.
Taking biological process (BP) namespace as an example, there are the following
four variables (similar for other two namespaces, but with `GOCC` and `GOMF`
prefix).

- `GOBPCHILDREN`
- `GOBPPARENTS`
- `GOBPOFFSPRING`
- `GOBPANCESTOR`


`GOBPCHILDREN` and `GOBPPARENTS` contain parent-child relations.
`GOBPOFFSPRING` contains all offspring terms of GO terms (i.e., all downstream
terms of a term in the GO tree) and `GOBPANCESTOR` contains all ancestor terms
of a GO term (i.e., all upstream terms of a term). The information in the four
variables are actually redudant, e.g., all the other three objects can be
constructed from `GOBPCHILDREN`. However, these pre-computated objects will
save time in downstream analysis because traversing the GO tree is
time-consuming.

The four variables are in the same format (objects of the `AnnDbBimap` class).
Taking `GOBPCHILDREN` as an example, we can convert it to a simpler format by:

- `as.list()`
- `asTable()`

`as.list()` is also suggested by **GO.db** in its documentations.

```{r}
lt = as.list(GOBPCHILDREN)
head(lt)
```

`lt` is a simple list of vectors where each vector are child terms of a
specific GO term, e.g., `GO:0000002` has a child term `GO:0032042`. The
element vectors in `lt` are also named and the names represent the relation of
the child term to the parent term. When the element vector has a value `NA`,
e.g. `GO::0000001`, this means the GO term is a leaf in the GO tree, and it
has no child term.

`toTable()` converts to a data frame:

```{r}
tb = toTable(GOBPCHILDREN)
head(tb)
```

Unfortunately, the first two columns in `tb` have the same name. A good idea
is to add meaningful column names to it.

```{r}
colnames(tb)[1:2] = c("child", "parent")
```

Please note, the previous column names `c("child", "parent")` are only valid
for `GOBPCHILDREN`. If it is from one of the three `GOBP*` objects, readers
please inspect the output to determine proper column names for it. E.g. you
should assign `c("parent", "child")` to `GOBPPARENTS`.

With `tb`, we can calculate the fraction of different relations of GO terms.

```{r}
tb = toTable(GOBPCHILDREN)
table(tb[, 3])
barplot(table(tb[, 3]), main = "BP")

tb = toTable(GOMFCHILDREN)
table(tb[, 3])
barplot(table(tb[, 3]), main = "MF")

tb = toTable(GOCCCHILDREN)
table(tb[, 3])
barplot(table(tb[, 3]), main = "CC")
```


 
We can look at the distribution of the numbers of GO terms in each object.

1. Number of child terms. The following plot shows it follows a power-law distribution (majority of
GO terms have very few child terms).

```{r}
lt = as.list(GOBPCHILDREN)
tb = table(sapply(lt, length))
x = as.numeric(names(tb))
y = as.vector(tb)

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data.frame(x = x, y = y), aes(x = x, y = y)) +
    geom_point() +
    scale_x_continuous(trans='log10') +
    scale_y_continuous(trans='log10') +
    labs(x = "Number of child terms", y = "Number of GO terms") + ggtitle("GOBPCHILDREN")
```

2. Number of parent terms. The term "GO:0008150" (biological process) is removed from the analysis because it is the top node in BP namespace and it has no parent term.

```{r}
lt = as.list(GOBPPARENTS)
lt = lt[names(lt) != "GO:0008150"]
tb = table(sapply(lt, length))
x = as.numeric(names(tb))
y = as.vector(tb)

ggplot(data.frame(x = x, y = y), aes(x = x, y = y)) +
    geom_point() +
    scale_y_continuous(trans='log10') +
    labs(x = "Number of parent terms", y = "Number of GO terms") + ggtitle("GOBOPARENTS")
```


`GOBPCHILDREN` and `GOBPPARENTS` contain "local/direct" relations between GO terms, `GOBPOFFSPRING`
and `GOBPANCESTOR` contain "local + distal" relations between GO terms.

```{r}
lt = as.list(GOBPOFFSPRING)
lt[1:2]
tb = toTable(GOBPOFFSPRING)
head(tb)
```

We can compare child terms and all offspring terms of "GO:0000002":

```{r}
GOBPCHILDREN[["GO:0000002"]]
GOBPOFFSPRING[["GO:0000002"]]
```

Constructing `GOBPOFFSPRING` from `GOBPCHILDREN` needs a recursive processing and it takes time:

```r
lt_children = as.list(GOBPCHILDREN)

add_children = function(term, env) {
    children = lt_children[[term]]
    if(identical(children, NA)) {
        return(NULL)
    }
    env$offspring = c(env$offspring, children)
    lapply(children, add_children, env)
}

i = 0
lt_offspring = lapply(lt_children, function(x) {
    i <<- i + 1
    cat(i, "/", length(lt_children), "\n")
    if(identical(x, NA)) {
        return(x)
    } else {
        env = new.env()
        env$offspring = character(0)
        for(y in x) {
            add_children(y, env)
        }
        unique(env$offspring)
    }
})
```

### Information of GO terms

Only we only see the GO IDs, the object `GOTERM` can be used to get the names and long descriptions
of GO terms.

```{r}
GOTERM
```

Similarly, you can use `as.list()` or `toTable()` to format this object:

```{r}
lt = as.list(GOTERM)
tb = toTable(GOTERM)
```

There are the following three types of useful information for each GO Term:

- GO name
- GO description/definition
- GO ontology/namespace

`Term()`, `Definition()` and `Ontology()` can be directly applied to `GOTERM`:

```{r}
head(Term(GOTERM))
head(Definition(GOTERM))
head(Ontology(GOTERM))
```

Moreover, you can get subset the `GOTERM` object:

```{r}
GOTERM[c("GO:0000001", "GO:0000002", "GO:0000003")]
```

With `Term()`, `Definition()` and `Ontology()`, it is convinient to add additional 
information of GO terms:

```{r}
Term(GOTERM[c("GO:0000001", "GO:0000002", "GO:0000003")])
Definition(GOTERM[c("GO:0000001", "GO:0000002", "GO:0000003")])
Ontology(GOTERM[c("GO:0000001", "GO:0000002", "GO:0000003")])
```


## Link GO terms to genes

**GO.db** only contains information for GO terms.
GO also provides gene annotated to GO terms, by manual curation or computational prediction.
Such annotations are represented as mappings between GO IDs and gene IDs from external databases,
which are usually synchronized between major public databases such NCBI.

### org.Hs.eg.db

To obtains genes in each GO term in R, Bioconductor provides a family of packages with name of
**org.\*.db**. Let's take human for example, the corresponding package is **org.Hs.eg.db**.
**org.Hs.eg.db** provides a standard way
to provide mappings from Entrez gene IDs to a variaty of other databases. 

```{r}
library(org.Hs.eg.db)
```

Similarly, `org.Hs.eg.db` is a database object.

```{r}
org.Hs.eg.db
```

You can use `select()` to obtain gene-GO term relations, but there are already objects calculated
and easier to use.
In this package, there are two objects for mapping between GO IDs and genes:

- `org.Hs.egGO2EG`
- `org.Hs.egGO2ALLEGS`

The difference between the two objects is `org.Hs.egGO2EG` contains genes that
are *directly annotated* to every GO term, while `org.Hs.egGO2ALLEGS` contains
genes that directly assigned to the GO term, *as well as* genes assigned to
all its ancestor terms. For example if term A is a parent of term B where A is more general,
genes with function B should also have function A. Thus `org.Hs.egGO2ALLEGS` is
the proper object for GO gene sets.

<img src="go_anno_true_path.png" />

Again, `org.Hs.egGO2ALLEGS` is a database object. There are two ways to obtain gene annotations to GO terms. 

- `as.list()`
- `toTable()`


```{r}
lt = as.list(org.Hs.egGO2ALLEGS)
lt[3:4]
```

If we compare to `org.Hs.egGO2EG` which contains incomplete genes:

```{r}
lt2 = as.list(org.Hs.egGO2EG)
lt2[3:4]
```

The gene IDs have names. They are evidence of how genes are annotated to GO terms.

Let's try `toTable()`:

```{r}
tb = toTable(org.Hs.egGO2ALLEGS)
head(tb)
```

Now there is an additional column `"Ontology"`. This is convinient because `org.Hs.egGO2ALLEGS`
contains GO terms from the three namespaces and the `as.list()` cannot distinguish the different namespaces.

```r
tb[tb$Ontology == "BP", ]

onto = Ontology(GOTERM)
lt[ onto(names(lt)) == "BP" ]
```

Let's calculate the frequency of evidence code:

```{r}
barplot(sort(table(tb$Evidence)))
```


Now it seems we have obtained the complete gene-GO relations.
Can we directly use `org.Hs.egGO2ALLEGS` as the GO gene sets? The answer is no, check
the gene annotation for "GO:0000002":

```{r}
org.Hs.egGO2ALLEGS[["GO:0000002"]]
```

A gene can be duplicatedly annotated to a GO term with differnet evidence code. Thus,
to obtain the GO gene sets, we need to take the unique genes.


```{r}
n1 = sapply(lt, length)
lt = lapply(lt, unique)
n2 = sapply(lt, length)

plot(n1, n2, xlim = c(0, max(n1)), ylim = c(0, max(n1)),
    xlab = "with duplicated", ylab = "without duplicated",
    main = "number of genes in GO BP gene sets")

tb = tb[, 1:2]
tb = unique(tb)
```

With `tb`, we can look at the distribution of numbers of genes in GO gene sets. It approximately follows a power-law distribution. This means majority of GO gene sets only contain intermediate numbers of genes.

```{r}
tb = toTable(org.Hs.egGO2ALLEGS)
tb = unique(tb[tb$Ontology == "BP", 1:2])
t1 = table(table(tb$go_id))
x1 = as.numeric(names(t1))
y1 = as.vector(t1)
ggplot(data.frame(x = x1, y = y1), aes(x = x, y = y)) +
    geom_point() +
    scale_x_continuous(trans='log10') +
    scale_y_continuous(trans='log10') +
    labs(x = "Number of annotated genes", y = "Number of GO terms") + ggtitle("GOBP")
```

And the distribution of numbers of GO gene sets that a gene is annotated.

```{r}
t2 = table(table(tb$gene_id))
x2 = as.numeric(names(t2))
y2 = as.vector(t2)
ggplot(data.frame(x = x2, y = y2), aes(x = x, y = y)) +
    geom_point() +
    scale_x_continuous(trans='log10') +
    scale_y_continuous(trans='log10') +
    labs(x = "Number of gene sets", y = "Number of genes") + ggtitle("GOBP")
```

Biocondutor core team maintaines **org.\*.db** for 18 organisms

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tb = read.table(textConnection(
"org.Hs.eg.db    Human   org.Ss.eg.db    Pig
org.Mm.eg.db    Mouse   org.Gg.eg.db    Chicken
org.Rn.eg.db    Rat org.Mmu.eg.db   Rhesus_monkey
org.Dm.eg.db    Fruit_fly   org.Cf.eg.db    Canine
org.At.tair.db  Arabidopsis org.EcK12.eg.db E_coli_strain_K12
org.Sc.sgd.db   Yeast   org.Xl.eg.db    African_clawed_frog
org.Dr.eg.db    Zebrafish   org.Ag.eg.db    Malaria_mosquito
org.Ce.eg.db    Nematode    org.Pt.eg.db    Chimpanzee
org.Bt.eg.db    Bovine  org.EcSakai.eg.db   E_coli_strain_Sakai
"))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tb[, 1] = paste0("`", tb[, 1], "`")
tb[, 3] = paste0("`", tb[, 3], "`")
tb[, 2] = gsub("_", " ", tb[, 2])
tb[, 4] = gsub("_", " ", tb[, 4])
knitr::kable(tb, col.names = c("Package", "Organism", "Package", "Organism"))
```

### Use the `select()` interface

This is normally a two-step process:

1. get all genes
2. get all GO terms

```{r}
all_genes = keys(org.Hs.eg.db, keytype = "ENTREZID")
tb = select(org.Hs.eg.db, keys = all_genes, keytype = "ENTREZID", 
    columns = c("GOALL", "ONTOLOGYALL"))
head(tb)
```

Then you might need to take the unique genes:


```{r}
tb = tb[tb$ONTOLOGYALL == "BP", 1:2]
tb = unique(tb)
head(tb)
```

## Practice

### {.tabset}

#### Practice 1

We have demonstrated a gene can be duplicatedly annotated to a same GO term. Taking 
`org.Hs.egGO2ALLEGS`, can you calculate the percent of GO terms that have duplicated genes?

#### Solution


```{r}
lt = as.list(org.Hs.egGO2ALLEGS)
n = length(lt)
nd = sum(sapply(lt, function(x) any(duplicated(x))))
nd/n
```


### {.tabset}

#### Practice 2

`org.Hs.egGO2ALLEGS` has already merged genes annotated to all offspring terms. 
Try to manually construct GO gene sets with `GOBPOFFSPRING` and `org.Hs.egGO2EGS`, then compare to gene sets
in `org.Hs.egGO2ALLEGS`.

#### Solution


```{r}
lt_genes = as.list(org.Hs.egGO2EG)
lt_terms = as.list(GOBPOFFSPRING)
```

For a GO term, we need to consider its offspring terms + the term itself:

```{r}
for(nm in names(lt_terms)) {
    lt_terms[[nm]] = c(lt_terms[[nm]], nm)
}
```

Merge annotated genes for all offspring terms:

```{r}
lt_genes_manual = lapply(lt_terms, function(x) {
    unique(unlist(lt_genes[x]))
})
```

Compare to `org.Hs.egGO2ALLEGS`:

```{r}
lt_genes_all = as.list(org.Hs.egGO2ALLEGS)
lt_genes_all = lapply(lt_genes_all, unique)

cn = intersect(names(lt_genes_manual), names(lt_genes_all))
plot(sapply(lt_genes_manual[cn], length), sapply(lt_genes_all[cn], length), log = "xy",
    xlab = "manual gene sets", ylab = "org.Hs.egGO2ALLEGS")
```
